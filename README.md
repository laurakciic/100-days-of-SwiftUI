# 100 Days of SwiftUI

## üìå Description

This repo will contain various technique, game & classic app projects following along [Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

## üìí Projects

Projects have helped & guided me through Swift & SwiftUI, but also offered me the opportunity to solve a couple of bugs & features within each one.

## üèÜ Challenges

Challenges are projects made entirely from scratch by myself, starting from the basic requirements outlined in the course.

### Preview

*Within each project there will be larger versions of the screenshots.*
