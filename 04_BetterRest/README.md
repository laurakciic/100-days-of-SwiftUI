## üìù [Quiz Highlights](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/ios-swiftui/views-and-modifiers)

The Create ML app can train models from CSV files.
>Your data should have one item per row, with titles as the first row.

<br/>

Static properties are owned by a type itself rather than instances of the type.
>Because they don't reference a specific instance, you can reference static properties inside initializers for regular properties.

<br/>

When we import a Core ML model into Xcode, it will automatically generate a Swift class for us to use.
>This lets us create an instance of the model and request a prediction in only two lines of code.

<br/>

Buttons require a closure that accepts no parameters and returns nothing.
