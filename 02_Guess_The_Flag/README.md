>[2.](https://github.com/laurakciic/100-days-of-SwiftUI/commit/b8d81d04e7095e4aa47ea9464ee2c0ed124c696a) When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.        
>[3.](https://github.com/laurakciic/100-days-of-SwiftUI/commit/a9369e1ee5e17540d33d49c82fa22075262ced01) Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.

## 📝 [Quiz Highlights](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/ios-swiftui/wesplit)

Semantic colors are colors that are named according to their use rather than according to their hue.
>For example, Color.primary might be light or dark depending on the device theme.   

<br/>

Gradients can be created using an array of colors or an array of color stops.
>Color stops include both a color and a position inside the gradient.

<br/>

Colors are views in SwiftUI.
>This allows us to use them directly inside stacks.

<br/>

The frame() modifier lets us specify a precise width and height for a view.

<br/>

Buttons must be given a closure to be run when they are tapped.
>Without some sort of action to run, the button would be pointless.

<br/>

Materials let us apply a frosted glass-style blur effect for our view backgrounds.
>When combined with foregroundStyle(.secondary) this helps ensure UI elements stand out well from the background.
